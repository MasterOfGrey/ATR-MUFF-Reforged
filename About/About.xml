This mod brings back the classic MUFF Unit, upgraded with a twist to enhance the new lore of ATR.

[i]"An upgrade to the original MUFF unit, inspired by the muffalos of the rim, which became obsolete with the emergence of the TORT. While technically smaller the TORT was a more secure caravan animal, and a superior assistance animal due to its advanced trainability. The MUFF designers subsequently went back to the drawing board to develop something able to fulfill its own niche.
Thus the Melee Usable Fighting Freight (MUFF) Unit was replaced with the Multi Utility Freight Form (MUFF) Unit, by a design team that really wanted to make an acronym fit a pre-determined word.
The new MUFF unit is an older sibling to the Nutrition and Mineral units; it too produces nutrient solution (though not as quickly) and uses more advanced spacer synthesis techniques to grow synthread instead of steel. This has the added perk of making it look even more like the muffalos that inspired it.
Unfortunately, the behavioral programming loops necessary to ensure it eats enough food makes it incompatible with even intermediate training, but it does still serve as an excellent caravan animal that will defend itself."[/i]

[list]
[*]Built-in patch for co-existing with Return MUFF
[*]No known incompatibilities.*

[u]The following mods are special cases:[/u]
*EdB Prepare Carefully eventually breaks all custom pawns; but that's their problem.
*Combat Extended does their own compatibility patches; this is fine if they're patched for ATR.

[b]Will this work with other older Android Tiers mods?[/b]
[i]No, ATR uses specific ATR tagged versions of things, which it calls upon to work.[/i]

[b]Can this be patched to work with other versions of Android Tiers?[/b]
[i]If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I have no intention of patching it myself though.[/i]

[b]Will you add the other localisations for other languages like ATR has?[/b]
[i]As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.[/i]
